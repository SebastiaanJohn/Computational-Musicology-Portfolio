I chose **Kanye West's** music because of his **progression in style** from his first studio album _The College Dropout_, to his more recent work of _Donda_ and _Jesus is King_ is remarkable. I have yet to find an artist who changes his style that much from album to album and **successfully keeps reinventing himself**. Hence I find it very interesting to base my research on him. In addition, I find it very interesting how he uses different techniques and forms of traditional music with technology and explores philosophical ideas through his lyrics, which are often thought-provoking for those who listen closely enough to hear them.

One of the most significant comparison points would be the **discrepancies between the various albums**. For instance, what attributes made each album feel so distinct but at the same time still recognize that it is a Kanye West album. I would think that the instruments and tempo are relatively different between his first and latest work. Furthermore, his lyrics have changed a lot over the decades, such as not swearing anymore, so I presume there could also be some interesting findings. 

Spotify holds all (and only) the studio albums of Kanye West; hence I don't suspect there will be any significant limitations.
